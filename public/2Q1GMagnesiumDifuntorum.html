        <h3>Taylor Swift's Early Life</h3>
        <p>Taylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989 in West Reading, Pennsylvania in the United states of America.
            In her early ages or childhood, she really enjoyed music and even performed in a chidren's theater. Her very 
            first performance in front of a crowd/huge audience was when she was 11 years old. During that time, she sang 
            "The Star-Spangled Banner" infront of thousands of people before a professional basketball game that happened 
            in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. At the age of 12, she started her passion of writing songs and at the age of 13, 
            she and her family moved near Nashville, Tennessee because Swift was inspired by country music artists. In her 
            new home, she tried to work very hard to break into the country music scene. Later on, in 2006, she signed with 
            a record label and then was able to release her very first single called "Tim McGraw" and then from here, she 
            continued to make more singles and then made her very first album which made her popular in 2007.
